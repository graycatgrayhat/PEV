# Charging Ports: Pros, Cons and Information

This post will be an attempt to provide pros, cons, and information about the charging port standards within the LEV space (ebikes, esk8, and escooters primarily).

### XLR(3-pin)

Pros:
- XLR could accept 14 AWG (1.6 mm or 0.063 in) wire with a current-carrying capacity of 15 amps.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types.
- One of the current ebike standards.

Cons:
- Generally more expensive than other connection types.
- Larger than DC jacks or two pin ports.

Information:
Generic quality XLR plugs don't have very good current handling for their size, and will often melt/ distort when used above 4 amps. Higher quality XLR plugs like the Neutrik XX brand (rated for 16 amps), which makes it an excellent choice for high current charging.

### DC Jack

Pros:
- Very common across LEV and hobbyist /craft builders.
- Simple plug and unplug system.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types. 

Cons:
- Too common, just because the port fits doesn't always mean it should.
- Lower constant amp ratings.

Information:
DC barrel connector has been a standard for powering electronic devices with low voltage DC in consumer electronics, and has found its way as a commonly used plug for the charging port of frame mounted batteries. Can be easy used for lights, DC-DC converters, and other accessories.

### GX16-3P

Pros:
- Very common across LEV, esk8 and electric scooters.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types

Cons:
- Generally protrudes from the mounted location.
- Lower constant amp ratings.

Information:

### Rosenberger

Pros:
- Magnets force the correct orientation and hold the connector together.
- Has two power lines and 4 signal lines, nominally for CANbus.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types.

Cons:
- More expensive than other connection types.
- Magnets can attract metal object and debris.
- Proprietary standard.

Information:
The Rosenberger connector was one of the standards adopted by [energybus](https://energybus.org/) as a battery plug.

##### Intentionally leaving out information that can vary from brand and manufacturer, like waterproof rating, max amps or material type.  Some points and info are a bit generic now as I wanted to do a quick post to get some input as well, picked four common ones but hope to expand the list.  Additions might include links to known good vendors or brands, more standard spec info, and of course more charge post.
