- Large varaity of port mounts and convers in water proof, locking and hardended types.
- One of the current ebike standareds.

Cons:
- Generally more expensive than other connection types.
- Larger then DC jacks or two pin ports.

Cons:
- Too common, just becasue the port fits doesnt always mean it should.
- Lower constant amp ratings.

### Rosenberger

Pros:

- Has two power lines and 4 signal lines, nominally for CANbus.
- Large varaity of port mounts and convers in water proof, locking and hardended types.

Cons:

(I picked four common ones, but hope to expand the list.)
