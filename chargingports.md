# Charging Ports: Pros, Cons and Information

This post will be an attempt to provide pros, cons, and information about the charging port standards within the LEV space (ebikes, esk8, and escooters primarily).

### XLR(3-pin)

Pros:
- XLR could accept 14 AWG (1.6 mm or 0.063 in) wire with a current-carrying capacity of 15 amps.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types.
- One of the current ebike standards.

Cons:
- Generally more expensive than other connection types.
- Larger than DC jacks or two pin ports.

Information:
Generic quality XLR plugs don't have very good current handling for their size, and will often melt/ distort when used above 4 amps. Higher quality XLR plugs like the Neutrik XX brand (rated for 16 amps), which makes it an excellent choice for high current charging.

### DC Jack

Pros:
- Very common across LEV and hobbyist /craft builders.
- Simple plug and unplug system.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types. 

Cons:
- Too common, just because the port fits doesn't always mean it should.
- Lower constant amp ratings.

Information:
DC barrel connector has been a standard for powering electronic devices with low voltage DC in consumer electronics, and has found its way as a commonly used plug for the charging port of frame mounted batteries. Can be easy used for lights, DC-DC converters, and other accessories.

### GX16-3P

Pros:
- Very common across LEV, esk8 and electric scooters.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types

Cons:
- Generally protrudes from the mounted location.
- Lower constant amp ratings.

Information:

### Rosenberger

Pros:
- Magnets force the correct orientation and hold the connector together.
- Has two power lines and 4 signal lines, nominally for CANbus.
- Large variety of port mounts and covers in waterproof, locking and hardened types.

Cons:
- More expensive than other connection types.
- Magnets can attract metal object and debris.
- Proprietary standard.

Information:

##### Intentionally leaving out information that can vary from brand and manufacturer, like waterproof rating, max amps or material type.  Some points and info are a bit generic now as I wanted to do a quick post to get some input as well, picked four common ones but hope to expand the list.
